# IOTG TSN Reference Software for Linux

## Overview

This project is a set of C-applications _and_ scripts used to showcase different
__Ethernet-TSN__ features in Linux on specific Intel IOTG platform/software.

These serve as a practical example for those interested in developing TSN-capable
software.

This project introduces **three applications**, each with their own set of _examples_:

* **TSQ** - Time Synchronization Quality Measurement
  * _tsq1_ showcases the nanosecond-precision time synchronization between platforms
    using pulse-per-second (PPS) output & auxiliary timestamping (AUX_TS) input pins.

* **TXRX-TSN** - AF_PACKET & AF_XDP socket-based application
  * _vs1_ showcases the bounded low-latency transmission/reception achievable via AF_PACKET
    & AF_XDP standard linux socket interfaces, while leveraging various
    device-specific Ethernet-TSN features.

* **OPCUA-SERVER** - AF_PACKET & AF_XDP OPCUA-based application
  * _opcua-pkt1_ showcases the bounded low-latency
    transmission/reception achievable via AF_PACKET over libopen62541
    (an OPC-UA-based library) APIs, while leveraging various device-specific
    Ethernet-TSN features over a single-ethernet connection. This application
    uses JSON files as an input.
  * _opcua-pkt2_ &  _opcua-xdp2_ showcases the bounded low-latency
    transmission/reception achievable via AF_PACKET & AF_XDP over libopen62541
    (an OPC-UA-based library) APIs, while leveraging various device-specific
    Ethernet-TSN features over **two** ethernet connection. This application
    uses JSON files as an input and require platforms with at least 2
    Ethernet-TSN ports (e.g. EHL).
  * _opcua-pkt3_ & _opcua-xdp3_ is the same as _opcua-*2_ but with iperf3 background
    traffic.

## Compatibility
```
Currently supported hardwares are:

	* Intel Atom XXX - (formerly Elkhart Lake) with its integrated Ethernet controller
	* Intel Core XXX - (formerly Tiger Lake UP3) with its integrated Ethernet controller

Currently supported systems are:

	* Yocto
	* Ubuntu
```

## Important
```
# Execute all the scripts in "root user"/"super user" privilege mode.
# There are two method to execute all the scripts in "root user"/"super user" privilege mode.

Method 1:
# Enter into "root user"/"super user" privilege mode using command below:
	sudo su

Method 2:
# Execute all the scripts using command below:
	sudo ./<script_name>.sh
```

## Dependencies

### General

#### *For system clock:*
```
# Please ensure the system clock is set to current date before using the installer script to install the required dependencies.
# Otherwise the installation will failed.
# Set the system clock to current date using command below:
	date -s YY/MM/DD
```

#### *For system shell:*
```
# Bash are required as system shell in order to compile and run TSN Reference Software.
# Install bash using command below:
	sudo apt-get install bash
```

#### *Packages Installer:*
```
# All the TSN Ref Sw App required dependencies can be install by using the packages installer below:

IMPORTANCE: Please read and follow the instruction below before using the packages installer!

# In order to ease the installation of generic packages and IOTG customized helper libraries (libbpf-iotg and sopen62541-iotg) needed,
# we have provide a installation script.
# The script will check out a specific version of the libraries from upstream git and apply our patches on top of it.

# Suggestion is to use the installer script (after having kept the original libbpf and libopen62541 in a safe place).
# This will ensure the tsn ref sw will be able to find/use correct libraries.

NOTE: If your kernel support for Intel XDP+TBS, please ensure the '__u64 txtime' descriptor is available in struct xdp_desc() in /usr/include/linux/if_xdp.h as example below:

/* Rx/Tx descriptor */
struct xdp_desc {
        __u64 addr;
        __u32 len;
        __u32 options;
        __u64 txtime;
};

WARNING: You are able to install libbpf & open62541 without the 'txtime' descriptor but you might facing error/failure during the tests.

# The packages installer branch : https://github.com/intel/iotg_tsn_ref_sw
# Branch name : **master**
# Use the commands below to install the packages:

	cd dependencies
	./packages_installer.sh --proxy=<your.proxy.if.necessary.com> --git-proxy=<your.git.proxy.if.necessary.com>

# NOTE: The proxy and git-proxy are optional arguments, provide if necessary.
# NOTE: The packages installer only support the overwrite installation.
# NOTE: Refer to the below

# NOTE: If you are installing the libbpf and libopen62541-iotg manually, there is a chance the related open62541-iotg.pc file is not there.
# Hence, you might have to comment out this line in **configure.ac**.

**AM_CONDITIONAL([WITH_OPCUA], [test "x$no_open62541_iotg_fork" = "x0"] && test "x${HAVE_XDP}" = "xyes")**

# Disclaimer
	* The packages installers only serves to install dependencies for TSN Ref Sw App.
	* This project is not for intended for production use.
	* This project is intended to be used with specific platforms and bsp, other HW/SW combinations YMMV
	* Users are responsible for their own products' functionality and performance.

# FAQ

	If git clone fail, try the solution below:
	* Please configure the proxy according to your proxy setting before git clone
	* Please configure the system date up-to-date before git clone
	* Please reboot your system before git clone
```
